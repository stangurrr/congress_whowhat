<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Anti-Lunch Shaming Act of 2017 </b></p> <p>This bill amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to establish requirements for the treatment of a child who is a student at a school participating in the National School Lunch Program or the School Breakfast Program and is unable to pay for a meal at the school.</p> <p>The bill applies to a child who either does not have funds to pay for a meal or has outstanding credit that was extended by a school food authority (SFA). </p> <p>A SFA may not permit public identification or stigmatization of the child, such as by requiring a wristband or hand stamp. The child also may not be required to: (1) perform chores or activities that are not required of students generally, or (2) dispose of food after it has been served to the child.</p> <p>Any communication related to outstanding credit must be directed to the child's parent or guardian. A child may be required to deliver a letter regarding outstanding credit that is addressed to a parent or guardian if the letter is not distributed to the child in a manner that stigmatizes the child. </p> <p>The bill also expresses the sense of Congress regarding several issues regarding the administration of the school meal programs. </p>]]></summary-text>
