The FDA may expedite inspection of such manufacturing facilities.</p> <p>The FDA must publish a list of brand name drugs for which all patents and exclusivities have expired and no generic drug application has been approved.</p> <p>(Sec. 802) Upon request, the FDA must provide review status updates to applicants with pending generic drug applications.</p> <p>(Sec. 803) The FDA may, upon the request of an applicant for approval of a generic drug, designate a generic drug as a competitive generic therapy and expedite the development and review of the application. A drug may be designated as a competitive generic therapy if there is not more than one approved, marketed drug that is the same drug.</p> <p>(Sec. 804) Holders of approved brand name or generic drug applications must notify the FDA: (1) 180 days prior to withdrawing a drug from sale, or as soon as practicable, and provide specified information including the reason for withdrawal; (2) within 180 days of approval of a drug if the drug will not be available for sale within 180 days of approval and provide specified information including the reason the drug is not for sale; and (3) within 180 days of enactment of this bill of whether their drugs on the FDA&rsquo;s list of marketed drugs are marketed. The FDA must update its list of marketed drugs based on this information.</p> <p>(Sec. 805) The FDA must annually report information regarding petitions for permission to seek approval for a generic drug application for a drug that differs from the brand name drug.</p> <p>(Sec. 806) The FDA must implement a protocol to expedite review of responses to inspection reports pertaining to certain drug applications, including applications for drugs in a shortage or drugs for which approval is dependent on remediation of conditions identified in the inspection report.</p> <p>(Sec. 807) The FDA must report quarterly on generic drug applications, including information regarding applications subject to priority review or expedited development and review and withdrawals of generic drug applications.</p> <p>(Sec. 808) First approved applicants for a competitive generic therapy are granted a 180-day marketing exclusivity period. There may be only one such period for a drug. This exclusivity period is forfeited by an applicant if the applicant fails to market the drug within 75 days after approval.</p> <p>(Sec. 809) For FY2013-FY2017, the GAO must report on the rate of approval of generic drug applications upon completion of the FDA's first review of an application. For years when the rate is below 20%, the GAO must report on the reasons for the low rate. The GAO must report on whether there are ways the generic drug review process could be improved to increase the rate of approvals upon first review.</p> <p>TITLE IX--ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS</p> <p>(Sec. 902) The FDA must annually publish information regarding the past year&rsquo;s inspections of drug or medical device facilities, including the amount of time between steps in the inspection process.</p> <p>(Sec. 903) The bill revises requirements for performance reports under user fee provisions for prescription drugs, medical devices, generic drugs, and biosimilars, including to require quarterly publication of information regarding guidance and meetings. Performance reports must include: (1) an analysis of changes in the number of full time equivalents hired under user fee agreements and the number funded under the FDA budget, (2) an analysis of changes in user fee revenue amounts and review costs, and (3) the number of employees in specified FDA offices for whom time reporting is required and the number for whom it is not required.</p> <p>(Sec. 904) User fee performance reports must include an analysis of: (1) the number of product applications filed and approved, (2) whether the relevant FDA review office has met performance enhancement goals, and (3) circumstances affecting the ability of the FDA to meet review time and performance enhancement goals.</p> <p>The FDA must annually submit a corrective action report to Congress as part of user fee reporting. If the FDA determines that fiscal year goals were met, the report must include recommendations on ways to improve the product review process. If goals were not met, the report must include a description of the circumstances under which goals were missed and efforts to improve the FDA&rsquo;s ability to meet the goals.</p> <p>Each fiscal year, as requested, representatives of the FDA must meet with members of Congress and participate in a congressional hearing regarding user fee reports.</p> <p>(Sec. 905) The GAO must report on FDA expenses related to facility maintenance and renovation for FY2012-FY2019. The report must include an analysis of the FDA&rsquo;s ability to further its public health mission and review medical products by incurring such expenses.</p> <p>Beginning FY2024, the bill prohibits the use of user fees for: (1) maintenance, renovation, and repair of facilities; and (2) acquisition, maintenance, and repair of materials and supplies that are not necessary scientific equipment.</p> <div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div>]]></text>

    <dc:description>This file contains bill summaries and statuses for federal legislation. A bill summary describes the most significant provisions of a piece of legislation and details the effects the legislative text may have on current law and federal programs. Bill summaries are authored by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) of the Library of Congress. As stated in Public Law 91-510 (2 USC 166 (d)(6)), one of the duties of CRS is "to prepare summaries and digests of bills and resolutions of a public general nature introduced in the Senate or House of Representatives".
