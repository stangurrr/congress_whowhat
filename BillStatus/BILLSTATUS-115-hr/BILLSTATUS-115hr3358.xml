The majority of the funding in the bill is mandatory funding for entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income that are funded in annual appropriations bills. These programs, known as appropriated entitlements, are included in annual appropriations bills, though the amounts provided for the programs are generally determined by authorizing statutes that control details of the programs such as eligibility rules and benefit levels. </p> <p>The bill decreases discretionary funding compared to FY2017 levels. It also includes provisions that affect polices in areas such as: </p> <ul> <li> implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, </li> <li> abortion, </li> <li> human embryo research, </li> <li> fiduciary standards for providing investment advice for pension and retirement plans, </li> <li> collective bargaining, and </li> <li> needle exchange programs. </li> </ul> <p><b>Full Summary: </b></p> <p><b>Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 </b></p> <p>Provides FY2018 appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and several related agencies. </p> <p>TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF LABOR </p> <p><i>Department of Labor Appropriations Act, 2018</i></p> <p>Provides FY2018 appropriations for agencies and programs within the Department of Labor. </p> <p>Provides appropriations to the Employment and Training Administration for: </p> <ul> <li> Training and Employment Services, </li> <li> the Job Corps, </li> <li> Federal Unemployment Benefits and Allowances, </li> <li> State Unemployment Insurance and Employment Service Operations, </li> <li> Advances to the Unemployment Trust Fund and Other Funds, and </li> <li> Program Administration. </li> </ul> <p>Provides appropriations to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. </p> <p>Provides appropriation to Labor for: </p> <ul> <li> the Employee Benefits Security Administration, </li> <li> the Wage and Hour Division, </li> <li> the Office of Labor-Management Standards, </li> <li> the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, </li> <li> the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, </li> <li>the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), </li> <li> the Mine Safety and Health Administration, </li> <li> the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and </li> <li> the Office of Disability Employment Policy. </li> </ul> <p>Provides appropriations for Departmental Management, including: </p> <ul> <li>Salaries and Expenses,</li> <li>Veterans Employment and Training, </li> <li> IT Modernization, and </li> <li> the Office of Inspector General. </li> </ul> <p>(Sec. 101) Prohibits Job Corps funds provided by this bill from being used to pay the salary and bonuses of an individual at a rate that exceeds Executive Level II. </p> <p>(Sec. 102) Permits specified Labor funds to be transferred between accounts and sets forth requirements for the transfers. </p> <p>(Sec. 103) Prohibits funds provided by this bill from being used for the procurement of goods and services utilizing forced or indentured child labor. </p> <p>(Sec. 104) Requires specified funds available for job training grants under the American Competitiveness and Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act to be used only for competitive grants to train individuals who are over the age of 16 and are not in school within a local educational agency in the occupations and industries for which employers are using H-1B visas to hire foreign workers, and the related activities necessary to support the training. </p> <p>(Sec. 105) Prohibits a recipient of Employment and Training Administration (ETA) funds from using the funds to pay the salary and bonuses of an individual at a rate in excess of Executive Level II, with an exception for vendors providing goods and services.

(The rule defines who is a fiduciary with respect to pension and retirement plans. Under current law, a person who provides investment advice has a fiduciary obligation that requires the person to provide advice in the sole interest of plan participants and beneficiaries. The rule changed the definition of "investment advice" to treat people who provide investment advice to pension and retirement plans for a fee or other compensation as fiduciaries in a wider array of advice relationships.) </p> <p> TITLE II--DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES </p> <p><i>Department of Health and Human Services Appropriations Act, 2018</i></p> <p>Provides FY2018 appropriations for agencies and programs within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). </p> <p>Provides appropriations to the Health Resources and Services Administration for: </p> <ul> <li> Primary Health Care, </li> <li> the Health Workforce, </li> <li> Maternal and Child Health, </li> <li> the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, </li> <li> Health Care Systems, </li> <li> Rural Health, </li> <li> Program Management, and </li> <li> the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program Trust Fund. </li> </ul> <p>Provides appropriations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for: </p> <ul> <li> Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; </li> <li> HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Diseases, and Tuberculosis Prevention; </li> <li> Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases; </li> <li> Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion; </li> <li> Birth Defects, Developmental Disabilities, Disabilities and Health; </li> <li> Public Health Scientific Services; </li> <li> Environmental Health; </li> <li> Injury Prevention and Control; </li> <li> the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; </li> <li> the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program; </li> <li> Global Health; </li> <li> Public Health Preparedness and Response; </li> <li> Buildings and Facilities; and </li> <li> CDC-Wide Activities and Program Support. </li> </ul> <p>Provides appropriations to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for: </p> <ul> <li> the National Cancer Institute;</li> <li> the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; </li> <li> the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research; </li> <li> the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; </li> <li> the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; </li> <li> the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; </li> <li> the National Institute of General Medical Sciences; </li> <li> the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; </li> <li> the National Eye Institute; </li> <li> the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; </li> <li> the National Institute on Aging; </li> <li> the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases; </li> <li>the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders; </li> <li> the National Institute of Nursing Research; </li> <li> the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism; </li> <li> the National Institute on Drug Abuse; </li> <li> the National Institute of Mental Health; </li> <li> the National Human Genome Research Institute; </li> <li> the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering; </li> <li> the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health; </li> <li> the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities; </li> <li> the John E.
