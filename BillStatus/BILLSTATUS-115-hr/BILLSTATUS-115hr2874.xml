Currently, the program provides coverage to insure the cost of mitigating future flood damage to an NFIP-insured structure that has been substantially or repetitively damaged by floods. </p> <p>TITLE V--PROGRAM INTEGRITY</p> <p>(Sec. 501) The bill makes FEMA responsible for ensuring NFIP is financially sound.

FEMA is also required to establish a probable maximum loss target for the program each fiscal year. </p> <p>(Sec. 512) The GAO must report on options for simplifying NFIP. </p> <p>(Sec. 513) The GAO must report on the mandatory purchase requirement. </p> <p>TITLE VI--ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS</p> <p>(Sec. 601) Fraudulent or false statements in connection with a flood insurance claim under NFIP make a person subject to civil enforcement, penalties, and suspension from the program. The bill directs FEMA to refer evidence of this activity to the Department of Justice.</p> <p>(Sec. 602) FEMA is directed to revise the appeals process for policyholders seeking review of a flood insurance claim denial by their insurer. A decision shall be provided to the policyholder.</p> <p>(Sec. 603) Claims under NFIP must be approved or denied no later than 90 days after the claim is made, with provisions for an extension in extraordinary cases.</p> <p>(Sec. 604) The bill gives FEMA litigation oversight and strategy authority in litigation conducted by Write Your Own companies.</p> <p>(Sec. 605) FEMA may not hire in connection with NFIP any disbarred or suspended attorney.</p> <p>(Sec. 606) FEMA may rely upon technical assistance reports when adjusting claims made under NFIP only if the reports are final and meet professional standards.
